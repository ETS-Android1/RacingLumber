Goals:
1) Provide data that is insightful and more easily read that existing data logging solutions
2) Record data at acceptable accuracy under processing and memory constraints
3) Record data for up to 15 minutes

The below calculations were for determining how to handle memory storage.  Although they
are now outdated (I might store a combination of timestamps/other data in the future),
the below calculations show that the second option presented below is the preferable
of the two and is more than capable of meeting storage requirements.

Constraints:
1)Test device(Samsung S7) has
-1.7GB of RAM available
-19GB of storage
Therefore, RAM is the limiting factor.  Aim for up to 1GB used for storage.

Storage options:
xyz of the accelerometer and rotation type sensors data needs to be adjusted such that gravity points
directly down in the adjusted coordinate system.  Otherwise, a phone shifting could alter output data
and data may look skewed on a 2D plane.

Option 1: 
Calculate adjusted data prior to storing it in real time using the gravity vector.
[(xyz of Accelerometer + xyz of rotation) in float]*(4bytes/float)*100 samples/second
= (6)(4)(100) = 2400 bytes/second (2.4kB/s)
In 1GB of RAM,
1,000,000kB/(2.4kB/s) = 416666 seconds of recording = 6944 minutes = 115 hours.
This handily meets requirements, with 15 minutes of recording requiring 2.1MB

Option 2:
Calculate adjusted data after recording with a recorded gravity vector.
[(xyz of Accelerometer + xyz of rotation + xyz of gravity) in float]*(4bytes/float)*100 samples/second
= (9)(4)(100) = 3600 bytes/second (3.6kB/s)
In 1GB of RAM,
1,000,000kB/(3.6kB/s) = 277777 seconds of recording = 4629 minutes = 77 hours.
This also meets requirements, with 15 minutes of recording requiring 3.2MB

Option 2 is better, because option 1 requires more calculations during recording (to adjust the coordinate
system), while option 2 still meets storage requirements.
